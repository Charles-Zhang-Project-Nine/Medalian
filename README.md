# Medalian

A constructed language set in the background of ancient **Medalian culture** from the plant **Kai** inside a remote galaxy.

When The Creator accidentally initiated the simulation program 13.8 billion years ago, our universe was born through a sequence of randomized parameterization. 9.257 billion years later, our planet Earth was formed in the galaxy of The Milky Way. In year 36,759 BCE, The Creator moved half of the Neanderthal population at that time to a remote planet located in the galaxy of Andromeda 2.57 million light-years away named Kai. That is the origin of the first generation of Medala people.

# Methodology

* Word design: As a form of *validation* - think about "throwing away" in such a sense that **due to lack of coherent meaning to different group of people and context** the concepts as brought up and defined by some words can be completely *eliminated*, especially in the case of **those words whose underlying meaning have great diversity** - e.g. religion, hinduism, India.
