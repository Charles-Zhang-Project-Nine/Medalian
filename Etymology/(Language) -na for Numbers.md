"na" means "numbers".

fu-na is associated with wind (number gods and number associations).

Besides being neat to have a (dedicated longer) name for some numbers (which may be used as digits in numerical systems), it's also "convenience by design": such than when enunciating numbers there is less chance of confusion (like in English -teen vs -ty, and in Chinese 一 vs 七)
