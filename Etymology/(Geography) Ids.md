The original spelling looks too much like "Kai (开)".

# Morphology

From Kai -> Ka-i -> Kayi -> 卡伊/卡一/卡依 -> Keyi -> 剀伊 -> Eyơs -> Iơs (Romanization: Eos/Eous) -> Ids (Idəs, 伊登斯/伊德斯) (Romanization options: Idos, Idas)

Ids: Might be related to the root of "yi/_i". "Ids" is romanization - it looks like it could be 1YY VCC - in actual Medalian though, this planet is written in two glyphs and is thus a 2 YY (Phenophonologically it can be considered either 2-3 VCC: Id+s, or I+de+s): Yi(3)+dəs(5). Chinese translation would be: 水星/球。
