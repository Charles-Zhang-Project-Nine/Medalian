"Medala" stands for the Medalian species - it is just a Tellurian romanized way to call everything related to the Medalian species, including its language.

However, the actual Medalian language (invented by **Ora Sevia Tuma** and **Ora Sham Dζlinm**), is called (PENDING) (can be related to the scripts *Xilika* and *Uensuri*). Some suggested translations for inspiring the name: 正音语，统一语.
