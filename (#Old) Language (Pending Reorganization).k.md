* "ma" is a commonly used (spoken use) word - consider the case of "???" in Japanese. It's used for acklowledgement and all sorts. The tone also varies depends on circumstance.
* (Miah, Classic) In classic Miah language (the pre-modern one), each verb can have as many as a hundred meanings - such meanings, called "sense", depends specifically (NOT on the context, but entirely on the sentence) on the nouns that follows. In a sense, a *verb+noun* pair, or a "verb phrase" convey one specific meaning - differ by both the type of object (which might be summarized grammatically), or more likely specific objects (e.g. "raise" the volume vs. "raise" some fund can have different verbs, even though same sort of meaning - as in English). Apparently many of such usages are conventional, and no particular rule exists - you just encounter it, learn and remember it, then use it. 
* (remark) Notice so far there are several kinds of languages to consider: 1) Machine Code itself, mostly concerning encoding, and instruction assembly (related to also machine architecture); 2) Programming language at various generations (from assembly to low level to high level to super high level); 3) Machine Instruction Language (Machine Intent) in the form of natural-language-like format, consult various ideas for Airi KMD; 4) Miah current modern spoken language among most populations (excluding dialets) - which may or may not be exactly as the one they use for Machine Intent; This could also be the hieroglyph like sort of language - consider it used mostly on a computer interface; 5) The Dark Kind language set (multiple protocols and communication channels); 6) Miah classic (ancient/ancestry) language, which have both different grammar and vocabulary. I am thinking of this more as a traditional script-based language, hand-written. 7) There are various dialects, and variations between spoken, written and literature languages; 8) Human- adopted languages, including mostly English, Chinese, Japanese - maybe some Latin, Hebrew, etc. 9) The glyphy-functional language of the Portkey that Supreme Being invented as interface language. 10) Inside the innerworld Supereme Being might speak a differerent (spoken) language suitable for its way of making sound. 11) The language of mathematics as a higher level construct in general: simple arithematics, diagrams and algorithms, functional programming.
