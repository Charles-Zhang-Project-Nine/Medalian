# Overview

Symbol name (word/letter name): PENDING <!--Pending figuring out the meaning of that NFC Kirin logo so we can dig into appropriate etymology-->

# Description

一个人站在一座山上

# Notes

* (Inspiration) "一个人站在一座山上的抽象的/线条/简化的形态" (九层楼珺胤 Logo)
* (Etymology) The exact shape/form design of this glyph ultimately also depends on the sound of the actual word - especially if Medalian uses an alphabetical-like glyph assembling system, then there will be rules for how we can construct the writing from sound.
