# Semantics Table (Experimental Proposal)

All primary meanings/1st class YY/single-YY/vocabulary roots with 1st-class meanings. Devices: YY, tone.

# Rules

* Notice every single-YY can *override meanings of otherwise singleton pure Consonant or pure Phoneme vowels*
* We should usually reserve Tone 1 and Tone 5 together instead of distinguish them too much.
